Journal: Reflection 

Artemis financial is a software company that was looking to reinforce security as well as add a file verification process to enable secure communications. They were seeking consultants too give them direction on how to make their system more secure for themselves and their customers. Due to the potentially delicate nature of some of the information they have in their system, they had to make sure they met the correct government security standards while creating the new system. 

When looking through the clients code for vulnerabilities I tried to document as much as I could and make notes for where improvements could be made. This is important because thinking about security is paramount when dealing with sensitive information. The working prototype didnâ€™t have to be perfect, but I made sure to notate areas in which variables would have to be changed and accessors implemented. Software security can add to a company's overall rating by providing customers with peace of mind that their data is safe, and no infiltrators are able to access their secure data. This is important because it improves the public outlook of the company which will make people more willing to purchase products from that company. 

The vulnerability assessment was a great exercise for future dependency checking. I had difficulty at first because I was unable to get the system functioning, but once I configured the dependencies correctly it was interesting to read through the report and learn about all the known vulnerabilities. The amount of found vulnerabilities goes to show how important coding with security in mind is, and maintaining security through the lifecycle of the application. It was most helpful learning about the dependency checker and how useful of a tool it can be when looking for vulnerabilities. 

I increased layers of security by implementing encapsulation, error handling, and secure coding practices within the application. Certain functions relating to getting and retrieving encryption data were made private and unmodifiable to prevent tampering with the data or gaining information from the system. Certain variables were signified as unmodifiable and further protective practices went in to make the added code secure. Error handling was one of the techniques used to add security in to the system. By implementing effective error handling, infiltrators have a more difficult time disarming or gaining information from a system. 

While creating the application I did a lot of debugging to make sure the application was functioning correctly. Checking the status of variables in the debugger as well as making sure I was calling the right functions and constructors from supplied classes. The documentation helped a lot while refactoring the system and often times I would find myself reading through the documentation about different objects and methods available. After refactoring, I ran the project through the OWASP Maven Dependency checker again and documented and fixed any additional vulnerabilities that arose. This was extremely helpful be cause it allowed me to verify the integrity of the application after adding more code. 

Tools like the maven dependency checker and java implementable algorithms will be extremely useful to me for future projects. I am going into Computer Science as a developer, and I am excited at the experience I must gain and knowledge I must learn. One of the most useful tools I see myself using is the maven dependency checker, as it can be extremely useful to know where vulnerabilities are within an application. Security is important in an ever-evolving digital world, and the vulnerability checker is a great and easy tool to implement. 

From this assignment I would show them my insights into security requirements that represent my knowledge. Its important to implement security wherever possible, and being scurity concious from the start is a good trait in any problem solver. The project will be a good example of my security experience and direct experience.
